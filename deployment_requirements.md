Deployment Requirements for 1000 Users:

1.  **Backend (Django):**
    *   **Database:** Migrate from SQLite to a production-grade relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL. Implement database clustering or replication for high availability and read scaling.
    *   **Web Server:** Use Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests, static files, and load balancing.
    *   **WSGI Server:** Deploy Django with Gunicorn (or uWSGI) to serve the application.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Implement a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer) to distribute traffic across multiple Django application instances.
    *   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
    *   **Task Queues:** For background tasks (e.g., image processing, notifications), use a task queue like Celery with a message broker (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ).
    *   **Media Storage:** Store user-uploaded prescription images in a scalable object storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) instead of the local filesystem.

2.  **Frontend (React):**
    *   **Build & Serve:** Build the React application for production and serve static files efficiently.
    *   **CDN:** Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) to cache and deliver static assets globally, reducing latency and improving load times.
    *   **Web Server:** Serve the static frontend files via Nginx or a dedicated static file hosting service.

3.  **Mobile App (Flutter):**
    *   The mobile app's performance will largely depend on the backend API's responsiveness and scalability. Ensure the backend is robust enough to handle concurrent requests from 1000 users.

4.  **Infrastructure:**
    *   **Cloud Provider:** Deploy on a reliable cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure) for scalability, managed services, and global reach.
    *   **Containerization:** Consider containerizing the application (Docker) and orchestrating with Kubernetes for easier deployment, scaling, and management.
    *   **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement comprehensive monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, AWS CloudWatch) and centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, AWS CloudWatch Logs) to track application performance, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues.
    *   **Security:**
        *   Implement HTTPS for all communication.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web exploits.
        *   Regular security audits and penetration testing.
        *   Secure API keys and sensitive information using environment variables or secret management services.
    *   **CI/CD:** Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline) for automated testing, building, and deployment.

5.  **Scalability Considerations for 1000 Users:**
    *   **Concurrent Users:** Estimate peak concurrent users and design the infrastructure to handle that load.
    *   **Database Connections:** Optimize database queries and connection pooling.
    *   **API Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
    *   **Horizontal Scaling:** Design the application to be stateless where possible, allowing for easy horizontal scaling of backend instances.
    *   **Bandwidth:** Ensure sufficient network bandwidth for serving static assets and API responses.

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements to deploy the Pharmacy Web App for 1000 users, focusing on scalability, reliability, and performance.

## Instance Sizing and `t3.micro` Limitations for 1000 Users

Using `t3.micro` instances for a production environment with 1000 users is generally **not recommended** due to several critical limitations:

*   **Limited CPU Credits and Performance:** `t3.micro` instances are burstable performance instances, meaning they provide a baseline CPU performance with the ability to burst above it for a limited time using CPU credits. For 1000 active users, sustained high CPU usage is highly probable, leading to rapid exhaustion of CPU credits. Once credits are exhausted, the instance's CPU performance will drop to its baseline, severely impacting application responsiveness and user experience.
*   **Insufficient Memory (1 GiB):** A typical Django application, especially with multiple services (database, web server, WSGI server, caching, background tasks), will quickly consume the 1 GiB of RAM provided by a `t3.micro` instance. This will lead to excessive swapping to disk, significantly degrading performance and increasing latency.
*   **Limited Network Throughput:** While `t3.micro` offers "moderate" network performance, it is unlikely to handle the concurrent network traffic generated by 1000 users, especially considering image uploads (prescriptions) and frequent API interactions. This can lead to slow response times and connection timeouts.
*   **Single Point of Failure:** Relying on a single `t3.micro` instance for a production application with 1000 users introduces a single point of failure. Any issue with the instance (hardware failure, software crash, maintenance) will result in complete downtime for all users. High availability is crucial for this scale.

**Recommendations for Instance Sizing:**

For 1000 users, a multi-instance, load-balanced architecture is essential. You should consider:

*   **Backend (Django/API):** Start with at least `t3.medium` or `m5.large` instances, and scale horizontally (add more instances) as needed based on load testing and monitoring. Each instance should run Gunicorn/uWSGI behind Nginx.
*   **Database:** Use a managed database service (e.g., AWS RDS PostgreSQL/MySQL) with a sufficiently sized instance (e.g., `db.m5.large` or larger) and consider read replicas for scaling read operations.
*   **Caching/Task Queues:** Dedicated instances or managed services (e.g., AWS ElastiCache for Redis) for caching and message brokers (e.g., AWS SQS/SNS or a dedicated Redis/RabbitMQ instance) for Celery tasks.
*   **Object Storage:** Continue to use scalable object storage like AWS S3 for media files, as it's highly available and scales automatically.

The goal is to distribute the load, ensure redundancy, and provide sufficient resources to maintain a smooth and responsive experience for all 1000 users.
