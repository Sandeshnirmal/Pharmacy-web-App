- **Strength/Dosage** parsing (500mg, 10ml, etc.)
- **Frequency** detection (twice daily, BID, etc.)
- **Duration** extraction (7 days, 2 weeks, etc.)
- **Instructions** parsing (after food, before meals, etc.)

### **✅ 3. Intelligent Medicine Matching**
```python
# Multi-strategy matching algorithm:
1. Exact name matching (100% accuracy)
