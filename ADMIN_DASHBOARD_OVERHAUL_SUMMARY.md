4. **Order creation** → Normal ecommerce checkout
5. **Admin processes order** → Without seeing AI details

### **Admin Ecommerce Management:**
1. **Product Management** → Add/edit/manage inventory
2. **Order Processing** → Handle customer orders
3. **Customer Management** → Manage user accounts
4. **Prescription Review** → Verify prescriptions (without AI details)
5. **Reports & Analytics** → Business metrics (no AI metrics)

## 🚀 **Testing Instructions**

### **Admin Dashboard Testing:**

2. **Check navigation** → No AI test links should be visible
3. **View prescription analytics** → Should show verification rates, not AI accuracy
4. **Review prescriptions** → Should see processing results without confidence scores
5. **Check all ecommerce functions** → Orders, inventory, customers should work normally

### **Mobile App Testing:**
1. **Upload prescription** → OCR should still extract medicines
2. **Get medicine suggestions** → Should receive product recommendations
